# Bootstrap-Analysis-of-SaVanT
Three components:
1. Data pipeline for converting sample-signature matrix data to pandas dataframes
2. Scripts that investigate the actual data and then run Monte Carlo simulations on sample-signature matrix data (currently with the purpose of investigating preliminary results from SaVanT, a web-based molecular signature software).
3. Exploratory analysis in R with sample-signature matrix data
