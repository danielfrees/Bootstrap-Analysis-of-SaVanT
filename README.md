# Bootstrap-Analysis-of-SaVanT
Three components:
1. Data pipeline for converting sample-signature matrix data to pandas dataframes
2. Scripts that investigate the actual data and then run Monte Carlo simulations on sample-signature matrix data (currently with the purpose of investigating preliminary results from SaVanT, a web-based molecular signature software).
3. Exploratory analysis in R with sample-signature matrix data

Note: Daniel's analysis "Bootstrap_Analysis_B_Cells_Pneumonia.ipynb" has a secondary purpose of serving as a guide to our team's workflow & the bootstrapping process, and therefore has a lot of markdown code and explanation. If you're hoping to better understand the workflow of this project, that is a great place to start.
